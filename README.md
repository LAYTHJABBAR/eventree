# EVENTREE
React app for users to create and manage events. If you need to organize and keep track of attendees for an event, this web app provides an easy-to-use interface.

The list of available events is available to anyone to view, whereas creating, managing and joining events require users to be logged in.

Users have profile pages where they can view a list of events they have created or are attending, and upload pictures.
